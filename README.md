# Welcome to my ClassProjects
miscellaneous class projects that I am too proud of to get rid of.
# Projects Featured
- BlockbusterSort:
  - a data management system I created to organize a txt/csv file full of different media types such as movies, tv shows, albums, etc. I very much enjoy optimizing organization, so this project was fun and easy for me. I also am a media person so I appreciated getting to work with familiar titles.
- United Federation Of Planets:
  - another data management system that reads csv files with information on Starships such as name, registry, star class, and crew members and allows you to create a fleet of ships and print the organized information neatly. Again, the Star Trek theme pretty much kept me from falling asleep.
